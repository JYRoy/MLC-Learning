# MLC-Learning
Learning Machine Learning Compilation. The important open course in the MLC is Tianqi Chen's [course](https://mlc.ai/summer22-zh/schedule), but he spent a lot of time on tvm and didn't involve other compilers so that it looks like a tvm tutorial course.

The goal of this repo is to keep my learning process on MLC not only including tvm.
